## Update & Deploying code

To deploy your app to **Heroku**, you typically use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s master branch to your heroku remote, like so:

```sh
git push heroku master
Initializing repository, done.
updating 'refs/heads/master'
``` 

Use this same command whenever you want to deploy the latest committed version of your code to Heroku.
